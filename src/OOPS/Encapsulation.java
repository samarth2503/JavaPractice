// Hiding internal implementaion and highlight set of service we are offering is the concept of abstraction.
// Advantage of abstraction security
// Mainatnce become easy. Eg:- If we want to change the programming lanuage used for coding we can do it without affecting the end user GUI.
// by using interface and abstract classes we can implement abstraction.


// Encapusation 

// Process of binding data and corresponding methods into a single unit is encapsulation.
// Data Members + Behaviour is Encapsulation.
// Encapsulation = Data hiding + Abstaction
// tightly Encapsulated :- decalre each and every variable and methods as private.
// If parent class it not tightly encapsulated none of child class will be tightly Encapsulated.
